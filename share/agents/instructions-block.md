# Maelys CLI framework (maelys-cli @VERSION@)

This project builds its command-line interface on `libmaelys_cli`. The
complete guide is in `docs/maelys-cli-guide.md`; this block is the summary
that must hold for every change.

## Using a Maelys CLI from an agent

- Start with `PROGRAM describe --summary --format json --compact --non-interactive`,
  then `PROGRAM describe COMMAND_ID --format json` before invoking a command.
  Treat `input` and `outputSchema` as one public contract; never build a call
  from the human help text.
- Always pass `--format json --non-interactive` in automation. `--json` is an
  exact alias of `--format json`; `--compact` keeps one line.
- Exit `0` is success, `1` is an execution failure, `2` is a completed
  validation report that found violations. Success data is on stdout only;
  failures are a JSON envelope on stderr with a stable `error.code` and an
  actionable `error.hint`.
- Transactional commands plan by default and write only with `--apply`.
  Review the plan, then repeat the same invocation with `--apply`.
  `--dry-run` and `--plan` are rejected.
- Never pass rendering flags to a command whose `outputMode` is
  `protocol-stream`; its stdout belongs to the declared protocol.
- Unknown, duplicated or foreign options are refused. Fix the invocation
  instead of retrying it.

## Adding or changing a CLI action

One command is one entry of the central catalog (`maelys_cli_command_t`),
one handler and one JSON Schema file. In the same change, update:

1. the catalog entry, written with the declaration macros
   (`MAELYS_CLI_READ`, `_RECORDS`, `_TRANSACTION`, `_EXECUTE`, `_STREAM`,
   `_EXTERNAL`; `MAELYS_CLI_OPERAND*`; `MAELYS_CLI_FLAG`, `_STRING`,
   `_PATH`, `_UNSIGNED`, `_INTEGER`, `_SIZE`, `_DURATION`, `_CHOICE`,
   `_HEX`) plus `.required`, `.repeatable`, `.requires`,
   `.conflicts_with`, `.default_text` as designated fields;
2. the output schema: a JSON Schema file under the project's schema
   directory, embedded by `maelys-cli-embed` and referenced with
   `MAELYS_CLI_SCHEMA(symbol)`; never a hand-escaped C string;
3. the handler, which reads only through `maelys_cli_operand()`,
   `maelys_cli_option*()` and `maelys_cli_flag()`, and replies exactly once
   through `maelys_cli_succeed*()`, `maelys_cli_emit_record()` +
   `maelys_cli_finish_records()` or `maelys_cli_fail*()`;
4. focused tests: accepted and refused inputs, plan without write, `--apply`
   with write, error codes and exit codes, `describe COMMAND_ID` exposing the
   exact contract;
5. the generated CLI reference when the project keeps one.

Rules that must not be broken: no second usage string outside the catalog; no
hand-written argv parsing in `main()`; no product type inside the shared
framework; validation errors in causal order (command, options, values,
dependencies, operands, files, syntax, schema, state); explicit
`MAELYS_CLI_WRITE_REPLACE` / `MAELYS_CLI_WRITE_NO_REPLACE` on every file
write; external programs started with absolute paths and `execve`, never a
shell or PATH lookup.
